## We have made a difficult decision of ceasing active development on this repo as of Jul 2022.

## DeepSim Toolkit

DeepSim Toolkit is an open-source reinforcement learning environment build toolkit for ROS and Gazebo. It provides the building blocks of extensive advanced features such as collision detection, behavior controls, domain randomization, spawner, and many more to build complex and challenging custom reinforcement learning environment in ROS and Gazebo simulation environment with Python language.
